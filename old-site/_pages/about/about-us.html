<h2>Life discovered. Life shared.</h2>

<p class="BibleQuote"><span class="BibleQuote__Title">1 John 5:12 NLT</span><br/>“Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have God’s Son does not have life.”</p>

<p><b>Mission</b>: “Jesus came and told his disciples, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Matthew 28:18-20 NLT</p>

<p><b>Mission Motto</b>: Life discovered. Life Shared.</p>

<p><b>Vision</b>: To establish a local church family committed to loving God, loving people, and sharing with everyone in our community and beyond, real life in Christ.</p>

<p><b>Strategy</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GET CONNECTED on Sundays at 10:30am.</li>
  <li>GET HEALTHY by committing to a LifeGroup.</li>
  <li>GET GOING! Serve, support, meet needs & share Jesus.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Values</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Focus</b> – We will be guided by focusing on the mission Jesus gave His followers and the callings of the church to Evangelism, Ministry, Worship, Discipleship, and Fellowship, aware of our natural tendency to focus on self, those reached, and to slip in to maintenance mode, or busy church programming.</li>
  <li><b>Grace</b> – We will humbly serve and love one another and both the easy to love and difficult outside our church family. We will humbly submit and support the imperfect leadership of the church and put others first.</li>
  <li><b>Joy</b> – As we celebrate Jesus and live a life in God’s family our lives should be full of authentic joy than is attractive to those without God’s peace and forgiveness. We will have fun as a church family.</li>
</ul>
