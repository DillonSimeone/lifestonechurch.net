## Sermon Notes

Acts 15

What do we do with the Old Testament?

- The Old Testament proclaims God's:

    - *Character*{: class="sermon-answer"}
    - *Heart*{: class="sermon-answer"}
    - *Power*{: class="sermon-answer"}

- The Old Testament DOES NOT:

    - Let us *pick*{: class="sermon-answer"} and *choose*{: class="sermon-answer"}.

    - Give us a system to *remove sin*{: class="sermon-answer"}.

        Galations 3:1-4

        Hebrews 10:1-4

- What do we do with the Laws and Commandments?

    If it is repeated in the New Testament: *obey it*{: class="sermon-answer"}

    If it is not repeated: *be careful*{: class="sermon-answer"}

    We are under a *new covenant*{: class="sermon-answer"}.
