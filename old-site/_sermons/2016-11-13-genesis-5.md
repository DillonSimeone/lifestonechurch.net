## Sermon Notes

Genesis 6:1-7

### What we don't know:

Genesis 6:1-4; Jude 1:6-7; Job 1:6, 2:1, 1 Peter 3:18-22, 2 Timothy 3:16-17

Who are the sons of God?

Who are the angels of men?

### What we do know:

Genesis 6:1-7, Matthew 24:36-39, 2 Corinthians 6:14-18

The issue was choosing the **ungodly** over the **ungodly**.

The culture was defined by its:

* **Fallen heros**
* **Sexual perversion**
* **Widespread corruption**
* **Violent headlines**

### The choices we're left with

Romans 8:5-17, Psalms 139, John 4:22-24, Galations 2:20, 2 Chronicles 16:9, Ephesians 4:29-32

1. Follow what is **popular** and cause God **grief and pain**.

2. Find God's favor by **obedience** and **walking** with him.
