## Sermon Notes

Three things to think about:

Matthew 20:17-28, 23:1-12, Colossians 3:22-25, Romans 1:18-23, Psalm 19:1-4

1. You never know what kind of **servant** you are until someone **treats** you like one.

2. Our disobedience may not change **God's plan** for our life, but may greatly change how we **experience it**.

3. Only the **creator** can fulfill **creation**.
- Reuben means **behold a son**
- Simeon means **hearing**
- Levi means **attached**
- Judah means **praise**
