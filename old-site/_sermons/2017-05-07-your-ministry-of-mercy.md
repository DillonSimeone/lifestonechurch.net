## Sermon Notes

Matthew 5:7

Mercy is **love in action**.

Compassion-ate: **to enter into someone else's pain**.

Mark 1:40-45, Leviticus 14:13-14, 8:23-24

Whether you're a priest or a leper:

**It's the same sacrifice for all of us.**

Question: **What am I willing to do**?

Mercy is **the key to answered prayer**.

Isaiah 58:5-12
