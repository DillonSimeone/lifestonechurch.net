## Sermon Notes

Genesis 23

### Five Lessons From a Great Ending

Hebrews 11:13-16

Leviticus 25:23

Ephesians 5:21-6:4

1 Corinthians 7

1. Base all our priorities on **heaven**, not **earth**.

2. Real legacies are about **people**, not **possessions**.

3. Show we follow Christ by our **actions**, not our **title**.

4. The most important day of our **marriage** will be our **last**.

5. Live out, and pass on, the two greatest decisions of life:

    Genesis 24:1-9

    - Will I do what **God wants** me to do?

    - Will I have a **godly marriage**?
