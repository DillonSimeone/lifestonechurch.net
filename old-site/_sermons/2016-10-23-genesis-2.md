## Sermon Notes

Life as it was meant to be

1. The person we were meant to be:

   - Humanity is the pinnacle of God's creation.

   - All human life is sacred, and must be treated with dignity.

2. The life we were meant to live:

   - We were created to work with God.

   - We were given stewardship over all creation.

3. The marriage we were meant to have:

   - God was/is the creator and sustainer of marriage.

   - Marriage was the completion of a side by side partnership.

   - Marriage was the vehicle for unashamed intimacy.
