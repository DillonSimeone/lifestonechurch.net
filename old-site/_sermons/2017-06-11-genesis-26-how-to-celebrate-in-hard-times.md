## Sermon Notes

- Faith
- Finances
- Family

**Three Keys to Celebration During Difficulties**

1. Choose to leave my family a **savior**, not a sin.
2. Be more concerned about my:
  - **Righteousness** than my **riches**.
  - **Witness** than my **wealth**.
3. Understand that God's will for my life is far more about **others** than **me**.
