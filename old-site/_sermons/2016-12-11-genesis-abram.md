## Sermon Notes

* An **odd** beginning.

    Genesis 11:27-32

* An **amazing** call.

    Genesis 12:1-4

* A **great** start.

### Take Aways

1. Never forget that the word of God is the **word for God**.

2. Our purpose is to make **God's name great**, not ours.

3. We are **blessed** to be a **blessing**.

4. God loves to work in the most **hopeless** and **helpless** of situations.
