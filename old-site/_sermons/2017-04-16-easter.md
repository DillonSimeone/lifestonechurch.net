## Sermon Notes

Matthew 28:1-10, Luke 1:78

Mercy: undeserved forgiveness and unearned kindness.

When do I need God's mercy?

What happens when I accept it?

1. Ashamed: I need God's mercy when I've messed up. A HUMILIATED WOMAN:

   John 8:2-11

   Isaiah 61:1, John 12:47, Psalm 86:5

2. Angry: I need God's Mercy when I don't have what I need. A DISAPPOINTED MAN:

   John 5:2-9

   GOD'S MERCY makes the impossible possible.

   Luke 18:27, 2nd Peter 1:3a

3. Afraid: I need God's mercy when facing death. A DYING MAN:

   Luke 23:39-43

   GOD'S MERCY will save for Eternity (Jesus)

   John 11:25, Acts 2:21, Isaiah 30:18, Hebrews 4:15-16
