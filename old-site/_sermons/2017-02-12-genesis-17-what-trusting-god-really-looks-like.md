## Sermon Notes

Genesis 17

1. You need to **know** God, before you **commit** to God.

    He is a God who:

    Is all **sufficient** and all **powerful**.

    Pursues **us** more than **we** pursue **him**.

    Is more interested in **changing us**, than **blessing us**.

    Saves us in order to **save others**.

2. "Blameless" does not mean **sinless**, but the heart's desire to **stop sinning**.

3. We have to **walk with** God, to claim the **promises** of God.
