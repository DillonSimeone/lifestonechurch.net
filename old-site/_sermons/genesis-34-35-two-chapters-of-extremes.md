## Sermon Notes

Genesis 34 & 35

### Four Lessons from the Fallout

1. When we are heading in the **wrong direction**, we are heading in the **wrong direction**.

2. Where there is no **spiritual leadership**, sin will fill the **void**.

3. The only cure for **worldliness** is to **separate** from it.

4. Our greatest need is to be **reminded**, not **instructed**.

What relationship do I have with the **devil**?

Ephesians 5:8-9, Ephesians 6:10-12, John 10:10, 1 John 5:19, Romans 8:31-38
