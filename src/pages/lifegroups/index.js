        Connect to God by connecting to His people & His Word! LifeGroups are
        the heart of Lifestone Church. LifeGroups are small groups of people who
        meet once a week in order to connect to God by connecting to other
        people who love Him and to the Bible. This is where spiritual growth
        happens! Check out the details and select the group that works best for
        your family.
