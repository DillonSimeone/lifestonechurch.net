## Sermon Notes

On this journey we learn that peace is not the absense of trouble but rather the presence of God.

- What pain are you facing this season?
- What struggles are weighing you down?
- What anxiety and stress are stirring up chaos in your spirit?
- Maybe those pressures and problems are external; maybe they are internal battles. Either way, are you willing to open your heart to God’s peace even in the midst of your struggles?

1. Peace in our midst.

    Luke 2:14

    Mark 4:39

    John 14:27

2. Prince of Peace

    Isaiah 9:6

    Luke 2:19

    Psalm 46:10

3. Peace for those who  believe.

    Matthew 10:19 “do not be anxious,”

    Philippians 4:6-9

    Romans 5:1-5

**Philippians 4:8** Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

**Numbers 6:24-27** May Yahweh bless you and protect you; may Yahweh make His face shine on you and be gracious to you; may Yahweh look with favor on you and give you peace. In this way they will pronounce My name over the Israelites, and I will bless them.” (Priestly Blessing given to the Sons of Aaron to say over the people and bless them)
