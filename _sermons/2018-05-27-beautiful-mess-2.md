## Sermon Notes

1. What To emphasize

    Galatians 2:21/ Mark 8:36 & Micah 6:8

    - The good news–not rituals

    - The cross–not morality

    - Jesus–not justice

2. What To expect

    Matthew 13:1-23, Matthew 7:13-14 & Psalm 10:4

    - A mixed reaction

    - Many will be interested – few will follow

    - The biggest obstacle is always pride, not logic

3. What To remember

    1 Peter 3:15-16

    - Our life is just as important as our words

    - To Keep it simple – tell YOUR story & answer THEIR questions
