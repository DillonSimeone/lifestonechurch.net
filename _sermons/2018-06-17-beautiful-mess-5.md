## Sermon Notes

Will There Be Tears In Heaven?

1 Corinthians 3:10-15, Revelation 7:17 & 21:4
	
1. Our judgment will include both rewards and loss 

    Matthew 6:19-20
	
2. We’ll be judged by our actions and our motives 

    1 Corinthians 4:3-5

Why We Shouldn't Look Down On Or Criticize Other Christians

1 Corinthians 3:16 – 4:21, Luke 18:9-14

1. When we don’t get along – we vandalize God’s temple
2.  When we think we’re superior – we deceive ourselves
3. One day all of our own closets and motives will be exposed 
4. Everything we take pride in we ultimately received from God
