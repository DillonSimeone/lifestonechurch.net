Genesis 44

Is he messing with them or testing them?

TESTED:

1. If we follow Jesus we will be tested.

    1 Peter 1:6-7, 1 Peter 4:12-19, Hebrews 12:4-12

2. God's tests are always designed to reveal â€“ never to break.

    2 Corinthians 13:5 & 1 John 2:3-6, James 1:2-5, Romans 5:3-4, Hebrews 12:11-12

3.  God's tests seldom make any sense until they're over.

    1 Peter 4:12

4. The right answer is always the same: Do the right thing!

    1 Corinthians 10:13, Proverbs 4:18-19, Romans 1:18-32
