## Sermon Notes

1. The past can leave us paralyzed with **fear**, or paralyzed with **guilt**.

2. Not dealing with the **past** robs us of our **future**.

### Cleaning Out the Closet:

1 John 1:9, 2:1-2, Luke 19:10, Hebrews 7:24-25, 1 Peter 2:24, 5:8, Revelation 12:10, Romans 7:24-25, 8:1-2, 1 Timothy 2:5-6

1. We have to **face the truth**.

1. We have to **accept the truth**.

1. We have to accept **grace**, not **guilt**.

### Take Home Challenge

Your skeletons can be Satan's **greatest weapon**, or God's **most powerful tool**.
