## Sermon Notes

The temple model is you centered.

Temple thinking gravitates toward rules and rituals.

John 15:12, Galatians 5:6, Galatians 5:14

The Jesus model is centered on the you beside you.

The Jesus model results in obedience to God out of love for others.

We demonstrate our love for God by loving others.

The Jesus model is less complicated but far more demanding.

Philippians 2:5, Luke 6:27, Luke 6:36

What does love require of me?

What if?

Matthew 25:33-39
