## Sermon Notes

An accountable lifestyle is...

1. Transparent – A “Glass House” Mindset.

    Jeremiah 23:24, Proverbs 15:3, James 5:16, Matthew 5:14-16

2. Open to correction – An “Open Door” Policy.

    Proverbs 19:27, Proverbs 12:1, 17:10

We need it because...

1. We all have a Traitor within.

    Romans 7:18-23, 1 John 1:8-10, Proverbs 20:9, 1 Corinthians 10:11-13

2. Anonymity breeds sin – Transparency breeds best behavior.

    Ephesians 5:8-9, 1 Timothy 5:24-25, Ecclesiastes 12:14

3. The Christian life was never meant to be lived alone.

    Proverbs 27:17, Hebrews 10:24-25, James 5:16

About “butting in”

Proverbs 12:1, Galatians 6:1-2, 1 Thessalonians 4:11-12

1. Look for the “ounce of truth”

2. With Christians – butt in

3. With non-Christians – mind your own business

4. With those who won’t listen – save your breath
