## Sermon Notes

1. God is love, and He sent His Son as a sacrifice for us. This was Jesus, God's love from the start and His gift to each of us.

    Psalm 139

    Ephesians 1:4-6

2. We can know and rely on God's love - God's love is enough for us today, tomorrow, for always.

    Ephesians 3:17-19

    Romans 8:38-39

3. We love because God first loved us. God's love overflows within and through us to others.

    1 Peter 1:22

    1 John 4:7-19

How do you perceive God's love for you?

Do you feel you need to earn it?

Do you wonder if God's love is meant for you?

Do you see the overflow of God's love in your own life towards others?
