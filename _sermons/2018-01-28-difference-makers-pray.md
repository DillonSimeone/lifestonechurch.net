## Sermon Notes

The problem with prayer:

God wants us to be persistent.

Matthew 15:21-28, Luke 18:1-8, 1 Thessalonians 5:1, Ephesians 6:18

5 Keys to Talking with God:

1. You have to be on good terms.

    Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 1:23-28, 21:13, 28:9, Isaiah 59:2, 1 John 3:22

2. It can't always be about you.

    Ephesians 6:18, James 4:3, Matthew 6:33

3. It has to be a two-way street.

    Ecclesiastes 5:1-2, Proverbs 8:32-35, Psalm 46:10, Matthew 11:28-30

4. Just come with what you have.

    Ecclesiastes 5:1-7, Matthew 6:5-8, 23:14

5. Your goal should be to connect with the one you're talking to, not to get what you want.

"Our worst sin is prayerlessness, because of what it says about who we think is really in charge."
