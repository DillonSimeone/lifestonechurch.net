## Sermon Notes

Genesis 40, Mark 10:42-45

### Lessons learned the hard way:

1. Any **title** or **position** we have is used to **serve** others.

1. Commit to **telling truth** regardless of the **outcome**.

1. Commit to **obedience** regardless of **circumstance**.

Genesis 40, Luke 19:11-27

### God's plan for our life will always be about:

1. Serving **God** more than **ourselves**.

1. Serving **others** more than **ourselves**.

1. Building his **kingdom** more than **our own**.
