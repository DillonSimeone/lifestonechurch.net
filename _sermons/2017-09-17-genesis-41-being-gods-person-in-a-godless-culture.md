## Sermon Notes

John 16:33, 1 Cor. 7:28, Jam. 1:2-4, Rom. 5:2-5, Acts 4:13, 1 Pet 2:11-17

1. Lifeâ€™s answers are found in the **word**, not the **world**.

	**Nightmares** happen when we let the **world** determine our **dreams**.

2. Trials can **make** or **break** our relationship with God.

	Trials + Time + Trust = Great Faith

3. Live a life that demands an **explanation**...then **give one**.

4. **Forgiveness** is the key to **fruitfulness**.

5. Give God **permission** to take us from **Egypt**, or to use us in **Egypt**.
