## Sermon Notes

Right heart, wrong heading

### Lessons from a difficult start:

1. Focusing on our **dream** is a great way to lose God's **dream**.

2. **Godly** people can still make God look **bad**.

3. We can't have godly **character** without letting go of the **coat** and the **crowd**.

4. We can't spiritually **lead** until we learn how to **serve**.
