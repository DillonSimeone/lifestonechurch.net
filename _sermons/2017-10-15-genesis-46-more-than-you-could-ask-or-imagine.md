Surprise Ending

Genesis 45:16–46:8

What To Expect When Your Story Ends

1. The truth is, some people will hate the ending.

    Romans 8:28, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Romans 1:18-32

2. The good news is, followers of Jesus will be amazed by how the story ends.

	1 Corinthians 6:11, Ephesians 3:14-21

3.  We can’t judge what God is up to until he’s finished.

	Hebrews 11:6, Philippians 1:6

4. If our life is awesome,  we still haven’t seen anything yet.

      If our life is difficult, it will be worth it someday.

	Hebrews 11:29-41

5. Our greatest hope can never be fulfilled in this world.

	Titus 2:11-15, 2 Corinthians 4:4, 1 John 5:19, Revelation 21:1-4
