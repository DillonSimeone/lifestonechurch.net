## Sermon Notes

Grace:

Matthew 1:3, Mark 2:17, John 19:30, Ephesians 2:1-9

1. Grace is the absolutely **unmerited** favor of God.

    1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Isaiah 64:6

2.  When we look in the mirror we see our **best traits**.

    When we look in the binoculars we see others' **worst traits**.

    James 1:22-25, Matthew 7:1-5

3. God is in the business of turning **losers** into **winners**.

    Mark 2:17, John 19:30, Ephesians 2:1-9, 1 Peter 2:9-10, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11
