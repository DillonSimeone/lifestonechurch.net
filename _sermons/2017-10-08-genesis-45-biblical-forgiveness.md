## Sermon Notes

Genesis 45

### Biblical forgiveness is not...

Proverbs 19:11, Ecclesiastes 7:21-22, Jeremiah 31:34

Genesis 8:1, 2 Samuel 12:13-14, Proverbs 14:15

1. Merely excusing the excusable.
1. Spiritual amnesia.
1. Immediate removal of all the consequences.
1. Immediate restoration of trust.
1. Letting someone hurt you over and over again.

### Biblical forgiveness is . . .

Romans 12:17-21, Matthew 5:43-46

1. Refusing to seek revenge or be consumed by a past injustice.
1. A decision that becomes a feeling.

Why It’s So Important

Mark 11:25, Matthew 6:12-15, Matthew 18:21-35

1. Forgiveness is not an option, it’s a requirement.
1. Failing to forgive hurts us worse than them.
