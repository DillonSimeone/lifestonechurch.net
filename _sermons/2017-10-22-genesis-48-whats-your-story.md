## Sermon Notes

Genesis 48:1-22

Keys for finding our story:

Genesis 48:1-22, Deuteronomy 4:1-9, 6:1-9, Matthew 5:14-16

1. Our story is **the most valuable part of our will**.

2. How would those around us **tell our story so far**?

3. Our story needs to be **both told, and read**.

4. Itâ€™s never too late to **start a new chapter**.

Secret to living a fruitful life: **remain**.

John 15:1-17, Matthew 7:21-27
