<p>Sunday 2.4.18 @ Lifestone 9am AND 10:30am. Invite your friends to join us for "Football Sunday", an exciting video event that will play across America on the day of the Super Bowl. The video will feature the movement of God in the lives of professional football players in exclusive interviews with guys like Demario Davis, Jordan Hicks, Chris Maragos, Josh McCown, Trey Burton and Matt Forte sharing their faith in Christ.</p>

Please take advantage of this amazing opportunity to invite your friends, family, neighbors and co-workers to have FUN at church and hear the good news that God loves them and wants to dramatically change their lives for the better!</p>
