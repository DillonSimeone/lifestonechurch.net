<p>Warren Jeff's (the imprisoned FLDS prophet) home in Colorado City is now a Dream Center where abused and addicted women can discover a road to recovery through the power of Jesus Christ. Come out to Colorado City for the Short Creek Dream Center Clean Up this weekend Nov 10-13!</p>

<p>They have secured the building, the lights are on, the word is out, the need is great and there are many in the community right now that need these doors open. From carpet cleaning and fixing broken toilets, to painting, dusting and cleaning bathrooms, there is a lot to do to get ready to open. Go up for the weekend, go out for a day, they have plenty of space for you to stay!</p>

<p>Once the cleaning and minor restoration is done on the house, they can work on the healing and restoration of the people and the town! From skilled professions like electricians and plumbers to all hands on deck for vacuuming, sweeping and mopping they need it all! There is a job for everyone!</p>
