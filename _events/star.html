<p>Nearly 2,000 years ago, a miraculous star shone in the sky to signal to all the world that Christ, the Prince of Peace, had come. This Christmas, join us on Sunday mornings at 10:30 @ Lifestone for a breathtaking journey to “follow the star”, as we explore the exciting days leading up to Christ’s birth and the life-changing messages of hope, love, joy, and peace His coming brought to the world.</p>
