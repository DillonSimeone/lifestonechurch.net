<p>33 The Series: "A Man and His Design" is a 6 session Bible study that is designed to inspire and equip men to pursue authentic manhood as modeled by Jesus Christ in His 33 years on earth. Join us as we explore the basic foundations of authentic manhood and God's clear design for men. We'll take a look at meaningful insights into the current state of manhood and navigate through some realities that have created cultural confusion. The study will unfold God's mandates for all men and offer a clear definition of authentic manhood to help us on our journeys as men. We will also learn the 4 "faces" of manhood and how to anticipate and transition through these specific seasons of life.</p>
