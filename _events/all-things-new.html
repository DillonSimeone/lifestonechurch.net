<p>At Lifestone, we believe in God's awesome, powerful ability to make all things new in our hearts and lives. Join us Sunday Morning, December 31st at 10:30am as we celebrate the new year and talk about what 2018 has in store for us if we will allow Him to bring about the changes He wants to make!</p>

<p>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. The old has gone, the new is here!" 2 Corinthians 5:17</p>
