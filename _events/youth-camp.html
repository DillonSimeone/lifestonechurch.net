<p>Youth Camp Registration is now OPEN! Limited space. REGISTER SOON!</p>

<p>This is always one of the most exciting events for students! Our days at camp will be packed full of dynamic worship experiences-including one on a mountaintop- devotional teen Bible studies & group discussions, field games, beach volleyball, challenge courses, a giant swing, rock climbing, s'mores around campfires and a TON of fun!!!</p>

<p>We love this opportunity for students to step out of their everyday life and routine in order to spend time connecting with God and with their peers from several participating churches. Our prayer is that many students attending will begin to trust in Jesus as Savior for the first time as they hear the Good News that God loves them and that others will grow in their existing relationship with our Lord.</p>
