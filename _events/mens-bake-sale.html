<p>Help send our teenagers to Youth Camp this summer! Men, bust out those aprons and bring your tastiest baked good to church at 10am on Sunday May 13th. We'll hold a silent auction and all proceeds will be divided equally among Youth Camp participants. Please come ready to GENEROUSLY bid on these yummy treats and support our teenagers! Cash and check donations preferred.</p>
