<p>Want to make a difference in our valley? Why not give something that will have eternal rewards? Join us and our mission to show and share the love of Christ at the Concern Center. They're looking for volunteers to spend a few hours once a week, once a month, or whenever you can, in order to help those in need find food and clothing to get through the cold winter months. They've even set new hours to make it more convenient for you, your family, and our church community to join the mission by being open on Saturdays from 9am - Noon! You'll be the hands and feet of Jesus to many who are far from Him. Will you partner with us in doing something great in the name of Jesus? <a href="https://signup.com/client/invitation2/secure/2068795/false#/invitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Join the mission</a>.</p>
