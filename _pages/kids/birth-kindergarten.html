<p>The goal of Lifestone’s LITTLE LIFE ministry is to teach kids truths of the Bible with age-appropriate, fun, interactive experiences taught by committed volunteers who serve Jesus by  serving you and your kids. Lifestone is committed not only to cementing the fundamentals of faith into the hearts and minds of children, but also equipping parents and getting families talking about Jesus together throughout their week.</p>

<p>God still loved and cared for Adam and Eve even after they disobeyed. Through exciting songs, videos, and activities, our Little Life Age 3 - Kindergarten Class will have a blast studying this story of Adam and Eve, while we learn to obey God because He cares for us! See you Sunday!</p>

<p>When you walk in the door you’ll see signage directing you to your child’s check in. At the check in area, you will be greeted by a volunteer who will help you sign in your child. Your child is sure to have a blast and learn a lot through their kid-sized Bible lesson!</p>

<p>*** Our secure environments are staffed with loving volunteers who have all submitted to extensive background checks and interviews.</p>
