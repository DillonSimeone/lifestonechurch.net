  <h2 id="no-one-has-seen-the-father-except-the-one">#1 No One Has Seen The Father except the One:</h2>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 6:45-46</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">45</em> It is written in the Prophets: And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me— <em class="BibleQuote__Label">46</em> <strong>not that anyone has seen the Father except the One</strong> who is from God. He has seen the Father.</p>

<p>False teachers immediately lay claims to seeing God in visions because it is one of the easiest ways to make a truth claim counter to the good news of the gospel. Paul says these false teachers go “on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason” (Col. 2:18) and it shows they are not “holding fast to the Head” which is Christ. They like to quickly depart from what Christ clearly taught which brings about the question:</p>

<p>How many of Jesus’ teachings would I have to disagree with in order not to be His follower?</p>

<p>Jesus did not say a few people will make truth claims about him but he uses the term “<strong>many</strong>” will come in my name and the result? “They will lead many astray.” Matthew 24:5</p>

<p>The Apostle John aware of the many false teachers says:</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">1 John 4:1</em><br />
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, <strong>for many false prophets</strong> have gone out into the world.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">1 John 4:6</em><br />
We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</p>

<p>The us that John is talking about are those few selected sent ones (apostles) instead of the “many” who make a claim of representing Jesus. John says the way you can tell who is from God and what truth is, comes by listening to these Jesus sent (apostles) and there are not a lot of them but a few like Peter, James, John, and Paul. The other neat thing about these few apostles is that they teach the same thing and have the same message. Who has seen God in all of his glory? John 1:18 “No one has seen God” and later Paul would teach “no one has seen or can see Him” because He dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16).</p>

<p>The problem with false teachers is they take you away from the clear and precise teaching of Christ Himself and then down play apostolic teaching because they have a new revelation or new vision of how to do God’s work, which will eventually downgrade Christ’s true identity.</p>

<p>The easiest way to downgrade God’s Word and Jesus’ identity is to lay claim to your own power and position - Paul in 1 Tim. 6 said the false teachers have a “sick interest” or unhealthy craving for disputes and arguments over words.</p>

<p>Quick note: We do have the LORD appearing to Abraham in Gen. 18 could this be an example of Jesus taking on flesh to interact with Abraham? Colossians 1:15 indicates to look at Jesus is to see the invisible God - “He is the image of the invisible God.” We have other hints of this throughout the Old Testament with the angel of the LORD.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Colossians 1:19</em><br />
For in him [Jesus Christ] all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell</p>

<h2 id="you-are-from-below-i-am-from-above">#2 You are from below; I am from above</h2>

<p><strong>You are of this world; I am not of this world</strong></p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 8:23-24</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">23</em> He said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. <em class="BibleQuote__Label">24</em> I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.”</p>

<p>This closely ties in with no one has seen the Father except the One who is from God in John 6:46 - Jesus’ existence and distinction from His creation is not tied to earth but to heaven and eternity because He is God, He does not have a beginning or end.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Heb. 1:3</em><br />
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of His nature, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</p>

<p>God the Father speaking:</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Heb. 1:8</em><br />
But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>

<p>Jesus speaking in Revelation:</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Revelation 22:13</em><br />
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 8:58</em><br />
Jesus said to them, “I assure you: Before Abraham was, I am.”</p>

<p>This “I am” statement is tied to Yahweh of the Old Testament - the given name of God to Moses to tell the people of Israel that God is and has always been and is about to be very present in the lives of these people. Yahweh is a title reserved to teach God as self-existent, self-sufficient, and without beginning or end. As it is stated in Isaiah there is no God before me and there will be no God after me (Isaiah 43:10). The Holy Spirit, The Father, and The Son meet this definition of not created and eternal and we can find biblical evidence of the Holy Spirit called the Spirit of Yahweh (Isaiah 11:2), Jesus being given the name above all names (Philippians 2:9-11) and Isaiah 64:8 “But now, O LORD [Yahweh], you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.”</p>

<h2 id="jesus-will-not-do-guest-appearances-before-the-second-coming">#3 Jesus will not do guest appearances before the Second Coming</h2>

<h2 id="jesus-tells-us-not-to-follow-prophets-who-arise-and-do-great-signs-and-wonders">#4 Jesus tells us not to follow prophets who arise and do “great signs” and “wonders”</h2>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Matt. 24:23-26</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">23</em> “If anyone tells you then, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Over here!’ do not believe it!
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">24</em> False messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. <em class="BibleQuote__Label">25</em> Take note: I have told you in advance. <em class="BibleQuote__Label">26</em> So if they tell you, ‘Look, He’s in the wilderness!’ don’t go out; ‘Look, He’s in the inner rooms!’ do not believe it.</p>

<p>I had a visitor come to our church and ask, “what would you do if Jesus walked into your church today and performed many miracles?” Jesus’ answer to this might surprise you - “do not believe it” and again Jesus said, “do not believe it.” Jesus knew people would be wooed away by fanciful stories of seeing Jesus here or there and seeing great signs to deceive even the elect if that were possible.
Jesus visits and miracles - they always draw a big crowd and remember the big crowd or wide gate is another issue Jesus addresses.</p>

<p>Just remember that Paul teaches that Satan appears as an angel of <strong>__</strong>_____ (2 Cor. 11:14 and it’s not darkness). Satan’s work done in 2 Thes. 2:9 is with all kinds of false miracles, signs, and wonders and with every unrighteous deception among those who are perishing because they did not love the the truth.</p>

<p>When we use miracles and bizarre things to validate truth we are turning away from New Testament teaching and what Jesus warned us about in the command - “DO NOT BELIEVE!”</p>

<p>If you see Mary floating around in the Cathedral and Grandma at the temple you should remember Satan masquerades as a familiar spirit and angel of light - this is when you need most to turn to the Old and New Testament to find out what God is really saying and doing - it’s not cryptic and it it’s pretty clear but only if you love the truth of God’s Word.</p>

<p>Note on Jesus appearance from the New Testament - they all have 1 thing in common:
*All appearances of Jesus after the Ascension are visions in/from heaven -Paul on road to Damascus (Acts 9, 22, 26) and 2 Cor. 12, Stephen while being stoned (Acts 7), the book of Revelation as John is taken up (Rev. 4) and in the Spirit (Rev. 1).</p>

<h2 id="narrow-is-the-gate">#5 Narrow is the Gate</h2>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Luke 13:23-24</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">23</em> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them,
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">24</em> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Matt. 7:13-14</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">13</em> “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. <em class="BibleQuote__Label">14</em> For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Rev. 7:9</em><br />
After this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were robed in white with palm branches in their hands.</p>

<p>If the gate is narrow why are there so many people “vast multitude” that no one could number from all around the world (every nation, tribe, people, language)?</p>

<p>As God Himself comes into the world as the Light and Lamb he is not met with acceptance but rejection to a very religious people who were awaiting a Messiah - when he tells them who He is, they reject Him. Most people today do not want the authority of God, His Word, His Spirit, His Presence and Power because that offer to receive him comes with the surrender of self and the religious system that promoted righteousness apart from God’s gift.</p>

<p>The Bible belt is not an easy place to share the gospel, post Christian Europe is not an easy place to share the gospel - when we think of people and places around the world that get excited about the good news it is definitely not a wide gate but as Jesus taught, a narrow door when compared to the rest of society.</p>

<p>One of the biggest hindrances to a relationship with Jesus is religion itself.
The easiest way to widen the gate and gain acceptance is to go with the religious equation of salvation based on works - it looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong>_ + <strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong>_ + <strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong> = eternal salvation</p>

<p>Fill these blanks in with baptism, church attendance, tithing, keeping the commands, doing church work, do not drink this or eat that . . . the list goes on.</p>

<p>How much of my own righteous energy and strength get calculated into the salvation equation according to Jesus? After I am delivered from sin (saved) how much of my own strength is important to maintaining the relationship?</p>

<p>John 3:3 “You must be b__<strong>__ a</strong><strong>__</strong>__”
-How much credit do you take for your own conception and birth?</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 3:3</em><br />
Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>John 15:5 “apart from me you can do <strong>__</strong><em>__</em>”</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 15:5</em><br />
I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 1:12-13</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">12</em> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, <em class="BibleQuote__Label">13</em> who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

<p>Do most people go to heaven? Jesus’ answer is the gate is narrow. His invitation is for people to enter through that narrow gate and that is totally different from the world’s religious systems of trying to cover sin with a painfully itchy fig leaf of good works. Sin can only be dealt with by the blood of Jesus shed on the cross and there it is totally dealt with. The Old Testament could only cover sin (Old Testament atonement, Heb. 10:11 “which can never take away sins”). Jesus Christ offering Himself on the cross one time so “that He has perfected forever” (Heb. 10:14) by removing the sins of those being sanctified.</p>

<p>Once our trust and belief is in Jesus dying for our sin on the cross (Col. 2:14) and hearing Him cry out loud, “it is finished” (John 19:30 “paid in full”), we understand that our trust in Him at this point is to take us from the death that sins causes to a totally new life empowered by the Spirit who convicts us of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). This new life is lived in the resurrection power of Jesus Himself.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Romans 6:4</em><br />
We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">Colossians 2:11-12</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">11</em> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, <em class="BibleQuote__Label">12</em> having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>

<p>Do you disagree with Jesus on any of these 5 teachings?</p>

<p class="BibleQuote"><em class="BibleQuote__Title">John 8:31-32</em><br />
<em class="BibleQuote__Label">31</em> So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you abide in my word [my message and my teaching], you are truly my disciples, <em class="BibleQuote__Label">32</em> and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</p>
