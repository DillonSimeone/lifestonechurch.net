  <p>Does your religion teach man pre-existed in heaven as a spiritual being?</p>

<p>Follow Genesis 1</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have plants and trees on day 3</li>
  <li>We have birds and fish made on day 5</li>
  <li>We have livestock created on day 6</li>
  <li>We have one other “creature” made on day 6 and it says he was created in the “image of God”- the setting is not heaven but day 6 earth and he is formed from the dust and breathed into “. . . the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.” Gen. 2:8</li>
  <li>The flesh and bone man, made in the image of God, created on day 6 on earth is never put in heaven or seen as pre-existing in heaven</li>
  <li>To teach the image bearer man was created in heaven goes against “the good” creation and order found in Genesis 1 and 2</li>
</ul>

<p>To teach God made spiritual man (created in heaven) as a spiritual being then God made dust man (on earth) for spiritual man to inhabit is a teaching brought to the text (pulled from another location) - it confuses the text and robs Jesus the God/man of his unique position because Jesus - not Adam, did pre-exist as God (Spiritual being) who would take on flesh.</p>

<p>“the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.” -Gen. 2:7</p>

<p>The first mention of man in the Bible is not in heaven but being formed on day 6 on earth in the image of God.</p>

<p>Did David believe in a heavenly body (spiritual) existence before coming to earth?</p>

<p>Psa. 139:13 For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. 14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. 15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. 16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.</p>

<p>David never taught you formed me spiritually in heaven but just the opposite - you formed and knitted me in my mother’s womb - Ps. 139 uses two Hebrew words for formed “qanah” and “yatzar” - yatzar is the word found in Gen. 2 for God’s activity in making/forming Adam and is used in 139:16 “the days that were formed for me” - this is talking about God’s unseen activity of making David “intricately woven in the depths of the earth” - poetic language not for spiritual heaven making but for God knowing David before he was made and even ordering and shaping his days before he was born. This applies to all of us - God knows that much about those created in His image. Those who will bow and submit to Christ and his teaching as Lord and those who will not - Rev. 13:8 and 18:8. Isaiah 46:10 talks about God as being able to declare the end from the beginning.</p>

<p>Did John the Baptizer believe in a heavenly body (spiritual) existence before coming to earth?
John the Baptist was also formed in the womb like Jeremiah in 1:5</p>

<p>Jer. 1:5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”</p>

<p>How did God know Jeremiah? How did God know John the Baptist before He formed them? Because they had a spiritual pre-existence? -No because just like David, God is able to form and order their days before they are born- listen to the message of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>John 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.”
John 3:31 <strong>He who comes from above is above all</strong>. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. 32 He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony.</p>

<p>This is John the Baptist declaring he must decrease but Jesus must increase (John 3:30) - why? Because Jesus is from above - “He came from above” - nobody else comes from above. Even John the Baptist born full of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:15) knows Jesus is different from regular men because his existence did not start with Adam and dust on day 6 but Jesus is from above - unique and it will be part of the reason earthly people reject Him and His message/testimony.</p>

<p>The worse part of the polluted teaching of man pre-existing in heaven is they reject or pollute the unique teaching of Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>John 8:23 He said to them, “You are from below; I am from above.</p>

<p>You are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>

<p>Does it get any more clear or precise than this teaching from Jesus?</p>

<p>John 8:31 “. . . If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</p>

<p>You can not be a follower of Christ and believe and teach something other than Christ taught. “You are from below” “You are of this world” -That is what Christ taught.</p>

<p>John 8:42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. 43 Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</p>

<p>Today many can not bear to hear Jesus teach He is from above and not of this world - meaning He is God. When I teach humans pre-exist in spiritual form in heaven - I teach against Christ. I teach my godhood of pre-existence from heaven instead of my sinful manhood from the earth and womb. I become my own personal savior and what Jesus does is just a stepping stone to get me back on my godhood path. With all of this said, I reject Christ and His teaching and I substitute it with the pollution known as heavenly pre-existence.</p>

<p>John 8:58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, <strong>before Abraham was,
I am.</strong>” 59 So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</p>

<p>What did it mean that Jesus was from above?</p>

<p>“before Abraham was, I am”</p>

<p>“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.” -Rev. 22:13</p>

<p>Col. 1:16 For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth . . .</p>

<p>John 1:3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</p>

<p>When Jesus said He was from above he was saying, “before Abraham was, I am” - do you want to take that teaching away because you take it from Jesus when you raise your hand I say - hey Jesus, before Abraham was - I too was.” - you just made yourself god.</p>

<p>What happens when I teach I am from above?</p>

<p>This makes Jesus out to be a liar and the truth is not in me - I cease to follow Christ and his word. My message is no longer that of John the Baptist but something totally different: I must increase, he must decrease. This is our natural tendency - John 3 refers to it as darkness.</p>

<p>John 3:19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”</p>

<p>1 Cor. 15:45 Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46 But <strong>it is not the spiritual that is first</strong> but the natural, and then the spiritual. 47 <strong>The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.</strong> 48 As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</p>
