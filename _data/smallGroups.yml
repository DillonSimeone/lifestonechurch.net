        description: Ron and Diane moved to the Salt Lake valley at the beginning of 2016 to work with the churches in Salt Lake Baptist Association. For 35 years Ron has served as pastor, church planter, and Team Leader for prayer and evangelism on the Colorado Baptist Convention state staff. They met in high school youth group at church and eventually married in 1978. They have a daughter and son-in-law in Colorado Springs, CO, and a daughter and son-in-law and grandson in Vale, NC. They have a strong desire for God to do something extraordinary so that Utah will see the wonder, might, and uniqueness of the only True God and His Son, Jesus. They are thankful to be a part of His work at Lifestone and serve as part of the First Impressions Team. They enjoy the safe place that LifeGroups offer in exploring God's word, sharing one another's burdens through prayer, and fellowshipping together.

        description: Sam and Rachael Coleman moved from Ft. Worth, Tx in 1999 to help with a small church in Pleasant Grove, UT.  They met through a mutual friend who was Rachael’s youth pastor and Sam’s college friend when Rachael was 15.  A few years later when Rachael was a Sophomore in college the same youth pastor partnered them together for a Disciple Now Weekend (which is an intense weekend long small group for youth).  The reason Sam and Rachael were put together according to the youth pastor was because these two are so different it should be interesting.  After 18 years of marriage, “interesting” is still the word for what Sam and Rachael bring to small groups.  We are excited to be a part of Lifestone Church with our four children Abigail (16), Atticus (14), Asher (8), and Adelai Shalom (7).  We are looking to form life-long friendships and work alongside others in our LifeGroups this year.
